🗨️ About

A real-time chat application built using socket programming concepts from computer networks. This application enables multiple clients to communicate simultaneously through a central server.

✅ Features Implemented

1. Core Functionality
   
     ✅ Real-time message broadcasting

     ✅ Multiple client connections

     ✅ User identification with unique names

     ✅ Connection/disconnection notifications

     ✅ Server-side message logging

2. Technical Implementation
   
     ❌ TCP socket communication

     ✅ Multi-threaded server handling

     ✅ Client-server architecture

     ✅ Proper socket lifecycle management

Technologies Used

   Node.js: Core programming language
   Express: Web server framework
   Socket.IO: Real-time communication
   JavaScript/HTML/CSS: Client interface


🚀 Installation & Setup

Prerequisites
   - Node.js 12 or higher
   - Network connectivity
   - All users (clients) and the server must be on the same WiFi network or mobile hotspot
   - Firewall on server system must allow incoming connections on port 3000


🔧 Usage Instructions

1. Start the server:
   - Open a terminal in the project folder
   - Run: `npm install`
   - Run: `node index.js`
   - The server will listen on port 3000

2. Find your server's local IP address:
   - On Windows, run `ipconfig` and look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter
   - Example: `192.168.1.5`

3. Connect clients:
   - On any device in the same network, open a browser and go to: `http://<server-ip>:3000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.5:3000`

4. Chat:
   - Enter a username when prompted
   - Type messages and press Enter to send
   - Messages sent by you appear on the right; messages from others appear on the left with their username
   - See when other users join/leave

5. Stop the server:
   - Press Ctrl+C in the server terminal

🌟 Key Computer Network Concepts Demonstrated
