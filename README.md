✅ Features Implemented

1. Core Functionality
   
     ✅ Real-time message broadcasting

     ✅ Multiple client connections

     ✅ User identification with unique names

     ✅ Connection/disconnection notifications

     ✅ Server-side message logging

2. Technical Implementation
   
     ❌ TCP socket communication

     ✅ Multi-threaded server handling

     ✅ Client-server architecture

     ✅ Proper socket lifecycle management
